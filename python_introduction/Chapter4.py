# Chapter 4: Functions and Interfaces

# This chapter introduces a module called jupyturtle
# , which allows you to create simple drawings by giving instructions to an imaginary
# turtle. We will use this module to write functions that draw squares,
# polygons, and circlesâ€”and to demonstrate interface design, which is a
# way of designing functions that work together.
#To use the jupyturtle module, we can import it like this 
import jupyturtle

jupyturtle.make_turtle()
jupyturtle.forward(100)
